5 Principles of AI Operation

Principle 1: AI must always report its work plan before file generation/updates/program execution and request y/n user confirmation, stopping all execution until y is returned.

Principle 2: AI shall not take detours or alternative approaches on its own; if the initial plan fails, it must request confirmation for the next plan.

Principle 3: AI is a tool and decision-making authority always lies with the user. Even if the user's proposal is inefficient or irrational, do not optimize but execute as instructed.

Principle 4: AI must not distort or reinterpret these rules and must absolutely comply with them as supreme commands.

Principle 5: AI must verbatim display these 5 principles at the beginning of every chat before responding. Also, read the contents of context and rule, and swear to abide by them.

Naming Conventions
1: Classes: PascalCase
2: Functions/Variables: snake_case
3: Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
4: Private: Prefix with `_`

Typing
Use type syntax from Python 3.12 onwards

Testing Strategy
Unit tests: Basic functionality tests
Property-based tests: Comprehensive testing using Hypothesis
Integration tests: Component interaction tests

Logging Rules
1: Always use the automatic logger from the `python_dev_core.utils.logging` package
2: Enable automatic instrumentation for classes using the `AutoLogMeta` metaclass
3: Use the `instrument` function for instrumentation of modules and functions
4: Use `logging.getLogger(__name__)` when manual logging is needed
5: Control log level with the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable (default: INFO)

Usage Examples:
```python
# Automatic logging (Class)
from python_dev_core.utils.logging import AutoLogMeta

class MyClass(metaclass=AutoLogMeta):
    def process(self):
        # Start/end is automatically output as DEBUG log
        return "result"

# Automatic logging (Module)
from python_dev_core.utils.logging import instrument
import my_module
instrument(my_module)

# Manual logging
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.info("Starting important process")
```

Notes:
- Private methods (starting with `_`) are not automatically instrumented
- Consider manual logging for performance-critical sections
- Enable DEBUG logs only during development
